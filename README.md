#  Salary Function (Python & R)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python and R for employee salary data processing, error handling, file export, and cross-language data access. The assignment focuses on importing salary data, retrieving employee details through a function, exporting employee data to a CSV file, compressing it into a ZIP file, and using R to unzip and display the exported data.

---

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:
- Import salary data into Python
- Create a function to retrieve employee details by name
- Process data using Python dictionaries
- Implement proper error handling
- Export employee details to a CSV file and compress it into a ZIP folder
- Use R to unzip the folder and display the exported employee data

---

## Folder Structure
- Salary_Function.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook (Python implementation)
- Total.csv # Salary dataset
- Employee_Profile.zip # Zipped employee profile (generated by Python)
- Employee_Profile/ NATHANIEL_FORD.csv # Exported employee CSV
- Salary Function R.r # R script to unzip and display data
- README.md # Project documentation


---

## Requirements

### Python
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - os
  - zipfile

### R
- R version 4.x
- Base R functions (`setwd`, `unzip`, `read.csv`)

---

## Instructions

### Part 1: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

1. Open `Salary_Function.ipynb`.
2. Ensure `Total.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run all cells in order.
4. Use the function below to retrieve employee details:
   ```python
   get_worker_details("NATHANIEL FORD")
5. Export the employee details to CSV and Zip: 
   ```python
   export_worker_csv("NATHANIEL FORD")
6. This will generate :
  - Employee Profile/NATHANIEL FORD.csv
  - Employee Profile.zip

### Part 2: R (Unzip and Display Data)
1. Open R or RStudio
2. Set the working diretory to the project folder
3. Run the script
4. The script will: 
- Unzip Employee_Profile.zip
- List extracted files
- Read and display NATHANIEL_FORD.csv

## Error Handling

- Python handles cases where an employee name is not found using `try-except`.
- Column mismatches and missing files are handled gracefully.
- R errors are avoided by explicitly setting the working directory before file operations.

---

## Sample Output

The Python function returns a dictionary containing employee details such as:

- Employee name
- Job title
- Salary components
- Total pay and benefits
- Year

The R script displays the same data in **tabular format** after extraction.

## Notes


- The ZIP file is created in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
- Ensure Python code is run before executing the R script.
